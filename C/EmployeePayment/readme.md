# Employee Payment work

This work was made and required some general documentation.

## Files

* Index.c
This file is being the main code file
* *.exe
This file is the one you get after compilation (Not included in the git)
* Input.txt
This file is used to provide the executable some input.

```txt
10
80
200
65
550
45
350
75
340
74
350
60
300
74
450
65
400
74
500
51
550
```

All this data in the txt, are numbers used in the the program. For example, the number 10, in the first line. Means the number of employees.

As the text file is not very intuitive or user friendly, I wouldn't recommend using it.
