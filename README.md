# Computer Science Projects - Charles David

This repository is to showcase my progress in the major of computer science.

## Topics

I will share any code learnt in the computer science class. Also planning on integrating how I learn flowcharts and how I create them, so I can receive easy feedback.

The actual topics right now are:
- Introduction to algorithms, Algorithms and data structure (Basic)
- How C manipulates data like character and a strings.
